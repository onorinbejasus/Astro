Use the tests lib.

Dependencies to run View:
JQuery min
View.js (in /tests)
Overlay.js (in /tests)


To create a view, all you need is a container like a div tag. In the example below, my html would have a div tag with id of container


$(document).ready(function(){
	var view = new View(document.getElementById("container"));
	var SDSSOverlay = new Overlay({
		view:view
	})
	var FIRSTOverlay = new Overlay({
		type:"FIRST",
		view:view,
		alpha:1.0
	})

})

Some other things to note, is the way to create overlays.
All overlays are created through an options object.
An options object needs only a view to attach onto to become active. Other options:

alpha  -- default alpha value will go to 1.
type   -- defaults to SDSS, can accept FIRST
placeholder -- defaults to undefined. This is the image that will display while an image is loading / failed to load. Won't show an image if not set(just black)

If you need to change the Alpha / placeholder after instantiating, you can use the setter methods:
setAlpha(newAlpha)
setPlaceholder(newPlaceholder)
